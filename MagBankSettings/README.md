# Mag's BankSettings

This add-on changes the default bank screen in Elder Scrolls Online.

A problem I often run into is, that I am often in a hurry to dump loot in the bank and get back to more looting. So I go open my bank but then I **fill up** my bag instead of emptying it because it defaults to the withdraw tab. This will change that so instead the first tab you see when opening your bank is your inventory in the deposit tab.

## Installation 

I recommend using [Minion](http://minion.gg) but if not possible or you prefer the manual method, either [clone this repository](1) into your `Addons` folder or [download](https://github.com/Magnum97/BankSettings/archive/master.zip) and unzip into your Elder Scrolls Online `Addons` folder.

## Support

If you have questions, need help or find a problem to report you can do so in [Github Issues](https://github.com/Magnum97/BankSettings/issues).

### Known Issues

Opening a House Bank (storage coffer) is not working. It seems addon is not receiving the callback from coffers. Looking at how this might be fixed.
