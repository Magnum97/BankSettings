# BankSettings

---

This add-on allows you to change the default bank screen in Elder Scrolls Online.

My biggest complaint about the game is that while I am often in a hurry to dump loot in the bank and get back to more looting I **fill up** my bag instead of emptying it because it defaults to the withdraw screen. I aim to change that.
